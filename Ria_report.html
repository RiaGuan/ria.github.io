			  <strong>Preliminary Macro Market Analysis: </strong>
			  <p>Our first step is to examine our data set. From the year 2000 to the end of 2022, the Boston residential sales market exhibited significant fluctuations, both in terms of the unit sale price and the total transaction volume, especially between 2016 and 2019. However, both aspects showed similar patterns of fluctuation until 2019, after which (especially by 2021) they began to exhibit different trends of fluctuation. Taking into account the context of COVID, we will mainly focus on exploring the changes in the Boston Residential Sales market between 2019 and 2022.</p>

				<comment><strong>In-depth analysis of the sales market from 2019 to 2022: </strong>
					By setting the <i>date</i> as a filter criterion, we have visualized the changes in transaction 
					volume and unit transaction price in the sales market from 2019 to 2022 through Tableau. 
					Among these changes, the unit price has been on a decline, while transaction volume has  
					increased due to the impact of price, which essentially still aligns with the supply and 
					demand balance of the housing market. As for the decline in the unit price of home sales, a 
					current subjective speculation is that it may be due to the impact of COVID leading to 
					economic downturn and a decrease in purchasing power for houses. However, more data is  
					needed to predict causality.</comment>
